# DeepTFni
A VGAE-based model to infer transcription factor regulatory network (TRN).
TRN is represented as an undirected graph, where V nodes represent TFs and 
E edges represent their interactions. The input of DeepTFni is solely a scATAC-seq
count matrix. The output of DeepTFni is the imputed TRN.
